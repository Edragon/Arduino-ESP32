#ESP8266 - Bulk Messages (Send Message to all users who /start using your Telegram bot)

This is a basic example of how to use UniversalTelegramBot on ESP8266 based boards.

The application will echo bulk messages to subscribed users.

NOTE: You will need to enter your SSID, password and bot Token for the example to work.

Tested on 5 subscribed users. I don't know what will be with 10 000 users, but 10 000 users better work with DB or something :)
Just for little community, for example send some data from your Arduino device to all your family or friends who using your Telegram bot.
