## Important
This library has been deprecated, the official Arduino library already supports Camera, please update the Arduino library for use [esp32-camera](https://github.com/espressif/esp32-camera/issues/7)


ESP32 Camera Ardunio Library
====================

Each example is tested using the TTGO T-Journal.

![jpg](./images/TTGOcam.jpg)

The example contains three programs:
- Upload a photo to the [BIGIOT](https://www.bigiot.net/) platform every 30 seconds
- WiFi Soft-AP mode video stream 
- WiFi Station mode video stream

In order to use the Station mode for video transmission quality, it should be as close as possible to the router, and the Soft-AP mode should be as close as possible to the device.

This library is based on [esp32-cam-demo](https://github.com/igrr/esp32-cam-demo) changes and is used in Arduino.

# Installing

 # How to use
- Change the WiFi ssid and password in the program.
- In Sota-AP you should connect `TTGO-CAMERA` and password is "`12345678`" , enter `192.168.1.1` in the browser to access the video stream.
- In the Station mode, If you use OLED ,you should enter the IP address displayed in the OLED for access. You can also enter the IP address in the log to access
- If you run the [BIGIOT](https://www.bigiot.net/) sample program, you need to add the device ID, interface ID, and password to add your wifi account.
