# DMA FRAME BUFFER MEMORY ALLOCATION

With version 1.2.2 of the library onwards, the framebuffer is split over multiple 'blocks' (mallocs) as a workaround to the fact the typical Arduino sketch can have a fragmented memory map whereby a single contiguous memory allocation may not be available to fit the entire display. 

For example when `heap_caps_print_heap_info(MALLOC_CAP_DMA)` is executed to print information about the available memory blocks that are DMA capable (which we need for a DMA-enabled pixel framebuffer), you may see something like this:

```
Heap summary for capabilities 0x00000008:

    largest_free_block 124856 alloc_blocks 0 free_blocks 1 total_blocks 1
  At 0x3ffe0440 len 15072 free 15024 allocated 0 min_free 15024
    largest_free_block 15024 alloc_blocks 0 free_blocks 1 total_blocks 1
  At 0x3ffe4350 len 113840 free 113792 allocated 0 min_free 113792
    largest_free_block 113792 alloc_blocks 0 free_blocks 1 total_blocks 1
  Totals:
    free 288496 allocated 26192 min_free 282544 largest_free_block 124856
```

So what? Well if you look closely, you will probably see two lines (blocks) like this:

```
  At 0x3ffc1818 len 124904 free 124856 allocated 0 min_free 124856
    largest_free_block 124856 alloc_blocks 0 free_blocks 1 total_blocks 1
  ...
  At 0x3ffe4350 len 113840 free 113792 allocated 0 min_free 113792
    largest_free_block 113792 alloc_blocks 0 free_blocks 1 total_blocks 1
```

What this means is there are two blocks of DMA capable memory that are about 100kB each.

The previous versions of the library were only able to use the largest single block of DMA capable memory. The library now is able to use non-contiguous blocks of memory.

Given it's possible to display 128x32 with double buffering in approx. 100kB of RAM. If we use two memory blocks for example, theoretically we should be able to display 256x64 or greater resolution (with double buffering disabled).

# Caveats

Experimentation will be required as available memory is highly dependant on other stuff you have in your sketch. It is best to include and use the 'ESP32-HUB75-MatrixPanel-I2S-DMA' library as early as possible in your code and analyse the serial output of `heap_caps_print_heap_info(MALLOC_CAP_DMA)` to see what DMA memory blocks are available.
