This is the root folder of FastLED.

Because of the way the Arduino IDE works, every header file put into this
root folder will become available to all other libraries.

This created horrible problems with header name collisions. Therefore, we mandate that
all new headers and cpp files that would have gone into this root folder, must now go
into the fl/ folder. All new classes, function etc must be placed into the fl namespace.

There will be a longer term migration to move all root-wise fastled code into the fl namespace with operations to bring those names into the global space, selectively.

For example:


**future example of how CRGB should be structured:**
```
// crgb.h -> fl/crgb.h
//
#include "fl/crgb.h"
using fl::CRGB;
```
